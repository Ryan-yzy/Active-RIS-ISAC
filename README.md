This document contains the simulation codes for my paper titled 'Active RIS Aided ISAC Systems: Beamforming Design and Performance Analysis'. In the 'convex opt' folder, you will find detailed implementation of Algorithm 1 for joint beamforming design. In the 'performance analysis2' folder, you can find simulation codes for the performance analysis discussed in Section V of the paper. Additionally, we have included simulation codes for plotting the beampattern shown in Figure 11, in response to suggestions from some readers.

We have also provided some details and personal comments on the simulation results. I hope you find these simulation codes useful. Feel free to contact me at zyyu@seu.edu.cn if you have any questions or need further assistance.
